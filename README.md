# ProMol-2.0-documentation
Documentation for refactored ProMOL-2.0 documentation.

31 March 2017

This github repository will hold documentation for the refactored version of ProMol.
The design should be as modular as possible, organized in terms of a bottom layer of
purely applicative functions (i.e. function which produce a clearly documented simple
output clearly documented inputs) used to build simple command-line filters.  The
functions and the filters will then be used, Unix-style, to support apps, more complex apis,
GUIs, web interfaces, etc.

If you have any questions about how to use this site, please post an issue. -- HJB
